Basically Diamond shape problem is occured in the multiple inhertance.
In a nutshell diamond shape problem is nothing but the confusion generated from inheriting multiple classes.
Python's syntax for multiple inheritance however, make's it lot more easier to tackle the diamond problem, But language like c++
generates errors.

JAVA DONOT SUPPORT MULTIPLE INHERITANCE.
