
#classes are nothing but a template to a particular peice of code that can be reused with the help of the object.

#Object: It is nothing but a instance of the class.

For example: If we write a email, we use a template for that purpose, then in this example:
Class: Template.
Object: Name and roll no that you fill in the email template

Object Oriented Programming uses the "DRY" concept which means, "Do not Repeat Yourself".
